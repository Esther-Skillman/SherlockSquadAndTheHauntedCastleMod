# Team planning

## Meeting roles

### Time and Place
Every Thursday starts at 13.00 in the booked room (could be different every week mainly 108 in the library) 

### Roles 
1-you must show your progress for the task you choose 
2-Everyone will give their options about the progress you made, and it will be recorded in minutes or separate template. 
3-can take a task for longer than two weeks if you didnâ€™t show enough progress or no work at all 
4-At the end of the meeting push document show the task and progress with everyone of the team options

### Git Hub Process

#### Branch
Create a folder (name) and inside three folders 
1-code to hold any Lua script you done 
2-level to hold any yaml file you modified 
3-art create inside two one for 3D art objects and the second for 2D objects.

#### Main and merge 
The main will have the full code from all branches. Manually will download all the new stuff and set it together then test everything is working and push to the main.

#### Push and pull. 
Push only to your branch unless it is a minute or design document or diagram.
Whenever a new version of the code (after marge manually) is ready will be pushed to GitHub then feel free to pull and use it, it will contain all codes, arts, levels and level shred for our mod from all the branches.

Push to your branch only what you create such as new Lua script, level shared after defining new object, 3D objects and others.
