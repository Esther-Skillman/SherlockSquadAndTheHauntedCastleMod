2-level to hold any yaml file you modified 
3-art create inside two one for 3D art objects and the second for 2D objects.

#### Main and marge 
The main will have the full code from all branches. Manually will download all the new stuff and set it together then test everything is working and push to the main.

#### Push and pull. 
Push only to your branch unless it is a minute or design document or diagram.
Whenever a new version of the code (after marge manually) is ready will be pushed to GitHub then feel free to pull and use it, it will contain all codes, arts, levels and level shred for our mod from all the branches.
Push to your branch only what you create such as new Lua script, level shard after defining new object, 3D objects and others.
